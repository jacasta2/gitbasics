# gitbasics

This is a repository created while learning **Git** basics following *Git and GitHub | Practical Course from Scratch* by [Fazt](https://www.youtube.com/c/FaztTech).  

Watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiXLkL42tMU). It is in Spanish. If you don't understand Spanish, try to configure the video with auto-generated English subtitles.  

I provide a thorough guide about the video in `video-highlights.md`.
