# gitbasics

This is a repository created while learning **Git** basics following *Git and GitHub | Practical Course from Scratch* by [Fazt](https://www.youtube.com/c/FaztTech).  

Watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiXLkL42tMU). It's in Spanish; if you can't follow it, configure the video with auto-generated English subtitles.  

I provide a thorough guide about the video in `video-highlights.md`. In a recent project I 'accidentally' deleted a file from **GitHub** (not locally) and found myself having issues pushing more stuff to that project's repo. I reproduced the issue in this repo to learn more from it and ultimately deleted this repo and created it again. In this re-creation, I first created the repo in GitHub and then cloned it locally. For this reason, the commits don't match those from the video guide. Apologies if this causes you any inconvenience when following the video guide.

I've been updating the guide with commands I've found useful when working on my projects.

When I started working on this repo, I had almost 0 Markdown knowledge. Visit Markdown Guide's [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to learn basic markdown syntax.
